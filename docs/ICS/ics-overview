## What is InsightCloudSec?

InsightCloudSec is a fully-integrated cloud-native security platform CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform)—your whole cloud security toolbox in a single solution. 

InsightCloudSec helps teams protect even the most complex multi-cloud and container environments from misconfiguration, policy violations, threats, and identity and access management (IAM) challenges. The solution features automated, real-time remediation to help you quickly respond to security and compliance risks.

<details><summary> What's a CNAPP?</summary>

A CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform), is a fully-integrated cloud-native security platform—your whole cloud security toolbox in a single solution. InsightCloudSec provides standardized visibility for multiple clouds to enable a single policy and single automation strategy to detect and remediate risk. We can provide event-driven harvesting to identify change in real time and assess risk in 60 seconds.

### Data collection and visibility

[Harvesting](doc:harvesting-overview) is the term for collecting data or the process of connecting with your clouds and pulling in the data stored there. InsightCloudSec provides a suggested harvesting schedule but also includes the flexibility to adjust your harvesting strategy based on your organizational needs. 

After InsightCloudSec harvests and normalizes data from your cloud accounts, you will start to see the resources, virtual services, utilities, or functions that make up your clouds displayed in the resource section of InsightCloudSec. This section provides visibility into your cloud footprint and allows you to drill down and inspect specific resources.

  We do our best to keep things up-to-date and provide the content you need around new features and capabilities.
